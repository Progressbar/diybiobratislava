The mission of DIYbio Bratislava is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds.

We are thinking with strategy, just build it and they will come.

We do this by providing equipment and workspace.

We want organize meetups for community to exchange ideas and learn about ongoing projects.

We believe that combination of an open laboratory and cutting edge research projects makes for an exciting learning environment.
